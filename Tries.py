Tries is useing for word validation
#=============================================================================================================================================================================

# The child of each node must be unique so at most for each node we have 26 unique child wich represent the lenght of english alphabet. Also, we dealing with 4 sub-function
# such as insert(), search(), startWith(). one of the advantage of using Tries is the startWith() function, which in compare to array reduce memory usage and time complexity

# Create seperate class named TriesNode: include children, endOfWord
