We use BFS & DFS for solving Graph related problems.

BFS uses Queue                                                                            DFS uses stack
BFS is iterative                                                                          DFS is recursive
Queue follows FIFO (First In First Out)                                                   Stack follows LIFO  (Last In First Out)
